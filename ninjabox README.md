### Troubleshooting

1. **Sudo Error**:
    - If you see "Error: This tool requires root privileges," run the script with sudo:
        
        bash
        
        –°–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å–ü–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ—Å–ò—Å–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç—å
        
        –ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
        
        `sudo ./wifininja.py`
        
2. **Network Interface Not Found**:
    - Ensure you are connected to a network. Check interfaces with:
        
        `ip link`
        
    - If the interface is not detected, specify it manually by modifying the get_network_info function to prioritize your interface (e.g., wlan0).
3. **No Devices Detected**:
    - Ensure the network has active devices.
    - Increase the scapy timeout in the scan_network function (e.g., change timeout=2 to timeout=5).
    - Verify the correct subnet is being scanned (displayed as "Scanning subnet: ...").
4. **Permission Error When Saving**:
    - If you encounter "Insufficient permissions to write file," ensure the directory has write permissions:
        
        `chmod -R u+w /path/to/directory`
        
    - Alternatively, run the script in a directory where you have write access (e.g., ~/).
5. **Missing Libraries**:
    - If a library is missing, install it with pip (as shown in the installation section).

### Advanced Customization

1. **Expand OUI Database**:
    - To add more device types, edit the oui_database dictionary in the get_device_type function. For example, to add a new device:
        
        `"00:xx:xx": "Device (Brand)"`
        
    - Obtain OUI prefixes from sources like macvendors.com or IEEE OUI lists.
2. **Modify Animations**:
    - To adjust the startup animation, edit the logo list in startup_animation.
    - To change the scanning progress bar, modify the loading_animation function (e.g., use a different character instead of ‚ñà).
3. **Add Features**:
    - **Port Scanning**: Integrate nmap or scapy for port scanning of detected devices.
    - **Traffic Analysis**: Use scapy to monitor packet counts per device.
    - **Web Interface**: Add a Flask-based web interface for browser-based access.
